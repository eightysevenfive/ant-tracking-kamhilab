## Overview
During the first week of the spring semester for NSCI607-06, I thought it would be a good idea to take inventory of everything I had from last semester and to create an outline for (1) what I should be learning, (2) what I need to program, and (3) what other things I might require for things to work. So, the next section focuses on what I currently have "done" and the next section details some logistical aspects for the completion of this project. At the end there is a section with my intentions for next week, the week of Feb. 07 to Feb. 13.

## Goals

1. Create a clean interface for ant researchers to extract ant path data from their videos of ants.
2. Use object detection to detect the paths ants take accurately.
3. Learn more about the intricacies of the $wx$ package in Python.
4. Learn more about OpenCV and object detection.
5. Gain skills in building decently complex things.

## Current State

1. A folder containing everything needed to run YOLOv3. There is a significant quantity of files that must be understood to run YOLOv3. I am a little bit rusty with the whole process but should remember quickly.
2. In order to apply the results of YOLOv3, there exists an IPython Notebook that uses the trained YOLOv3 to detect ants and works.
3. I have trained YOLOv3 on one ant video and used it to detect the ant in the same video.
4. I have just made a repository on GitHub with some of the more important files.

## TODO

1. Retrained YOLOv3 on a variety of ant videos and apply detection on a variety of ant videos.
2. Extract the path of the ants (probably via the bounding box) in each video.
3. Transition to YOLOv4 (this might not be necessary).
4. Make the detection more robust (no lapsing out of bounding box).
5. Create the GUI for the ant detection.
6. Create a tutorial on the training process works with YOLOv3.
