## Overview
For the fourth week of the spring semester for NSCI607-06, my plan was to continue labeling the bull ant videos, this time including a new object class for the head of the bull ant. Additionally,
I want to test the retrained weights from last week on the new videos, which had a different
backdrop and contained shadows, to see if the weights generalized well. YOLOv3 did not perform
well in this regard - all the more reason to keep accumulating the labeled videos.

## Updates and Current State

1. I have continued labeling bull ant videos.
2. There have been no updates to the Colab files.
3. I have added a new object class "bull ant head"
4. I tested the performance of the current YOLOv3 on new videos
5. YOLOv3 was overfitted on the previous training data
6. I updated some aspects of the GUI code I have, but didn't add that much

## TODO

1. Retrain YOLOv3 on a variety of ant videos and apply detection on a variety of ant videos.
2. Extract the path of the ants (probably via the bounding box) in each video.
3. Transition to YOLOv4 (this might not be necessary).
4. Make the detection more robust (no lapsing out of bounding box).
5. Create the GUI for the ant detection.
6. Create a tutorial on the training process works with YOLOv3.
7. Experiment with other methods for ant path extraction.

## Future Directions (unchanged)

1. A CNN trained on images with or without ants to detect the position of the ant. Next, one would index the images and plot the sequence of predictions, telling the network the prediction is wrong if it is beyond a certain distance away from the last prediction. There could be a head direction and body location for each image.
2. Perhaps a website may be a better platform for uploading ant videos than a GUI would be.

## Goals (unchanged)
- Generally  
1. Create a clean interface for ant researchers to extract ant path data from their videos of ants.
2. Use object detection to detect the paths ants take accurately.
3. Learn more about the intricacies of the $wx$ package in Python.
4. Learn more about OpenCV and object detection.
5. Gain skills in building decently complex things.
- More Specific
1. Explore alternate methods of object tracking.
