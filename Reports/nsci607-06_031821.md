## Overview
For the sixth week of the spring semester for NSCI607-06 I spent most of my time
attempting to debug the issue from last week. I began by accessing each folder
and testing whether or not certain components ran correctly. For example, I wasn't
quite sure if my 'obj' folder had to be in both 'build/darknet/x64' and 'darknet/data'.
It turns out that it only needs to be 'darknet/data' as I originally thought. Beyond
this, I scoured the Internet for solutions and didn't find must in terms of help
with my particular problem. Several issues other people had raised did help me by
showing me other things I had done sub-optimally. Fortunately, I figured out the
problem and the code is _finally_ running. The directory issue was fixed by
changing the arrangement of the folders and then changing the paths in the
train.txt, test.txt, and obj.data files. After this issue, I ran into a detection issue
from OPENCV, and fixed that by changing the image extensions from '.jpeg' to '.jpg'.

## Updates and Current State

1. All ant videos are labeled
2. I understand more about how YOLOv3 works
3. I've gained some more experience debugging code

## By Next Week

1. Analyze the performance of the algorithm on the ant videos
3. Look into improving the object detection to avoid the previous "shadow video" pitfall.

## TODO (unchanged)

1. Retrain YOLOv3 on a variety of ant videos and apply detection on a variety of ant videos.
2. Extract the path of the ants (probably via the bounding box) in each video.
3. Transition to YOLOv4 (this might not be necessary).
4. Make the detection more robust (no lapsing out of bounding box).
5. Create the GUI for the ant detection.
6. Create a tutorial on the training process works with YOLOv3.
7. Experiment with other methods for ant path extraction.

## Goals (unchanged)
- Generally  
1. Create a clean interface for ant researchers to extract ant path data from their videos of ants.
2. Use object detection to detect the paths ants take accurately.
3. Learn more about the intricacies of the $wx$ package in Python.
4. Learn more about OpenCV and object detection.
5. Gain skills in building decently complex things.
- More Specific
1. Explore alternate methods of object tracking.

## Future Directions (unchanged)

1. A CNN trained on images with or without ants to detect the position of the ant. Next, one would index the images and plot the sequence of predictions, telling the network the prediction is wrong if it is beyond a certain distance away from the last prediction. There could be a head direction and body location for each image.
2. Perhaps a website may be a better platform for uploading ant videos than a GUI would be.
