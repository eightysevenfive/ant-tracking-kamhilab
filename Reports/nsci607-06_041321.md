## Overview

For the tenth week of the spring semester for NSCI607-06 I began training YOLOv4 on all but one of the
videos. Since training on all the videos takes so long, the training must be performed in batches.
Each of these batches will run for approximately 4-8 hours before halting. The weights from training
are saved iteratively and can be seen as "slices" of progress from the training procedure. I expected
that the weights should be good after 3-4 more training batches. I currently have completed two
full runs.


## Updates and Current State

1. Training all videos is _in progress_

## By Next Week

1. Finish training all videos.
2. Analyze performance and determine weaknesses

## The Weights from 2 Runs

<!-- ## TODO (unchanged)

1. COMPLETE
2. Extract the path of the ants (probably via the bounding box) in each video.
3. Transition to YOLOv4 (this might not be necessary).
4. Make the detection more robust (no lapsing out of bounding box).
5. Create the GUI for the ant detection.
6. Create a tutorial on the training process works with YOLOv3.
7. Experiment with other methods for ant path extraction.

## Goals (unchanged)
- Generally  
1. Create a clean interface for ant researchers to extract ant path data from their videos of ants.
2. Use object detection to detect the paths ants take accurately.
3. Learn more about the intricacies of the $wx$ package in Python.
4. Learn more about OpenCV and object detection.
5. Gain skills in building decently complex things.
- More Specific
1. Explore alternate methods of object tracking.

## Future Directions (unchanged)

1. A CNN trained on images with or without ants to detect the position of the ant. Next, one would index the images and plot the sequence of predictions, telling the network the prediction is wrong if it is beyond a certain distance away from the last prediction. There could be a head direction and body location for each image.
2. Perhaps a website may be a better platform for uploading ant videos than a GUI would be. -->
