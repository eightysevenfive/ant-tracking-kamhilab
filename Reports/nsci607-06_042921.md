## Overview

NSCI607-06: I have kept retraining with different parameters but still seem to experience
some trouble on certain videos. Although, I have not yet been able to integrate the new
videos into the pipeline. Changing the ```steps``` parameter does not seem to boost results,
but I might need to do some more testing. I also worked this week on extracting the paths from the bounding boxes. It was fairly easy, which was nice. Now I need to format them appropriately
into a csv file, which may be slightly more difficult.

## Updates and Current State

1. Retraining to get better performance.

## By Next Week

1. I still need to label those 2 videos, but any more would be great.
2. Finish working on extracting ant coordinates.

## TODO

COMPLETED
1. Trained on all videos.
2. Created a tutorial on the training process works with YOLOv3.
3. Extracted ant paths

UNCOMPLETED
1. Make the detection more robust (no lapsing out of bounding box).

<!-- ## Goals (unchanged)
- Generally  
1. Create a clean interface for ant researchers to extract ant path data from their videos of ants.
2. Use object detection to detect the paths ants take accurately.
3. Learn more about the intricacies of the $wx$ package in Python.
4. Learn more about OpenCV and object detection.
5. Gain skills in building decently complex things.
- More Specific
1. Explore alternate methods of object tracking.

## Future Directions (unchanged)

1. A CNN trained on images with or without ants to detect the position of the ant. Next, one would index the images and plot the sequence of predictions, telling the network the prediction is wrong if it is beyond a certain distance away from the last prediction. There could be a head direction and body location for each image.
2. Perhaps a website may be a better platform for uploading ant videos than a GUI would be. -->
