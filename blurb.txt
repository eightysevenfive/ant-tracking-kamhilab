Many animal behavior studies require digitizing the movement of animals in videos for
further analyses. Much of the digitization in rodent research has been automated;
however, automating this process for behavioral videos of ants present a challenge due
to their small size. Therefore, to date, the collection of ant path data is often done
manually by recording each point along the path. In this project, the primary objective is
to develop a tool to automate the quantification of ant paths. Having such paths as
usable data is useful in behavioral research on topics on such as [*]navigation and
learning and memory. . To accomplish this task, we are in the process of training the
object detection algorithm YOLOv4 on various videos of ants moving along a particular
path. Once the algorithm works robustly and is modified to fit the constraints presented
by videos of ants, it will be incorporated into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using
the wx library in Python. The GUI would allow researchers to upload a video and then
collect the data produced by the program as a text file for analysis elsewhere. This tool
could greatly hasten the research pipelines of researchers who employ ants.
